#### How to write comments on Ruby

Comments in Ruby can be written in two ways:

* Single line comment

Single line comment followed by # symbol

```ruby
  # This is a single line comment.
```


* Multi line comments

Multiline comments starts with =begin and ends with =end

```ruby
=begin
  This is multiline comments.
  One can write number of lines as per need.
=end
```
