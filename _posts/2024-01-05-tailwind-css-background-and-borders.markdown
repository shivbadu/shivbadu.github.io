Let's explore some basic utility classes provided by Tailwind CSS for styling text elements.

## Background Color

You can set the background color of an element using utility classes like bg-red-500, bg-blue-700, etc., where the number represents the shade of the color.

```
<div class="bg-red-500 p-4">
    <p>Red Background</p>
</div>
<div class="bg-blue-700 p-4">
    <p>Blue Background</p>
</div>
```

## Background Opacity

You can also adjust the opacity of the background color using utility classes like bg-opacity-25, bg-opacity-50, etc.

```
<div class="bg-red-500 bg-opacity-25 p-4">
    <p>Red Background with 25% Opacity</p>
</div>
<div class="bg-blue-700 bg-opacity-50 p-4">
    <p>Blue Background with 50% Opacity</p>
</div>
```

## Border

Tailwind CSS provides utility classes for adding borders to elements. You can use classes like border, border-solid, border-dashed, border-dotted, etc.

```
<div class="border border-black p-4">
    <p>Border</p>
</div>
<div class="border border-red-500 border-solid p-4">
    <p>Red Border</p>
</div>
```

## Rounded Corners

You can apply rounded corners to elements using classes like rounded-sm, rounded-md, rounded-lg, etc.

```
<div class="bg-gray-300 rounded-lg p-4">
    <p>Rounded Corners</p>
</div>
```

## Box Shadow
